# CS145RA-Final-Project
Final Web Design Project 

# Overview

So there are 3 different branches on our project, the first being the main branch. This has our source code currently and will be iteratively updated with the code we will submit to our professor.
The other is a branch for me to do work on my side and another branch for you on your side. I just named them Jaden's Master Branch and Jenna's Master Branch respectively.
When either one of us is ready to submit the work we have done. You will just commit your work to your branch, then merge that with the main branch.
Hopefully we should have one final rough draft ready to go and do the final the same way.
